//Summary

Since the social media has changed the way we communicate. It is also changing the ways of expression, driven mostly by internet’s innate intent to hyperbolize and amplify to be different and stand out. This chase results in constant update of these slang terms, that are different enough to define a specific era of the internet culture.

//Inspiration

Social Media and the internet in general are primary modes of communication for me and everyone I know. There are things more than just words; memes, gifs, videos etc that help us get our messages across. Small and menial things take substantial meanings in the widespread but close-knit social media communities. Anything and everything is on the table. A picture, a word, a sentence, a flub, a gag or even a sincere moment can become part of online pop culture in a matter of minutes. These words become a part of our slang and get used over and over in various forms of media and communication, even transcending off screen to everyday conversations. As fascinating as this phenomenon is, there is something more interesting that takes place after. The words seem to disappear after a while, replaced with new words and phrases, derived from the same methodology, may even mean the same thing, but they just don’t get used to express and communicate anymore. To me that is very strange, because growing up I still remember almost all the words I learned, and I believe I use them to communicate even today. But, the fast-paced world of internet is changing and replacing vocabulary faster than ever before. It is so distinct that friends are able to point to others what year they are using the slang terms from because its only kewl to use current slang. That’s the only way to keep it 100!

//Research

Project required something that can simulate constant change and creation of slang terms. To find all the new slang terms, I had to look over articles and lists of what many websites thought were the current slang terms. Some were old articles and reading them made me chuckle because I found it absurd to see and think of those out of date terms. That is so beneath me. In the end, I had to go with what I see on social media myself and some materials from those articles.  
Process: 
At first the project was supposed to take another form, but I settled on this since it is more visually pleasing and relevant. In the process, I tried different ways to show a dynamic environment. First it was lust small lines fading across the screen, but that looked too cluttered. Then I decided on squares, which looked a bit better, but they had strokes. Removing the strokes and decreasing transparency produced a very soft and pleasing background. 
Then different keys are assigned to different pop culture phrases. For example, pressing the key ‘e’ will show TFW on the screen. These phrases disappear under the constant shapes that are being drawn over and over again. The connection between this and my inspiration is that it is easy to coin new pop culture phrases, just it is as easy to drown them out to make way for new ones, just like the internet does.
